    <br> 
    <p>also yes i typed my thoughts out like everything ur reading is just my thoughts, iris ur voice is like a song made by angels, ur humor is as funny as someone who tripped when he tried to rob someone (SORRY I HAD TO MAKE THAT JOKE), ur as pretty and cute as bunnies in the snow, ur as sweet as cotton candy and as perfect as could be.~Love Juliaan❤️</p>
